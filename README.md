Problems:
1. LED's are shit, so the corelation between PWM duty cycle and brightness is not linear, I need to create function that takes that into account
2. Timing is not precise (I think) this should be investigated
3. We need proto-threads for the button to feel good
4. Remodeled cover would be nice
